## Gesture recognition during video meetings

### About the client
Huddly combines hardware, software and AI to create intelligent vision products for everyone who uses video to collaborate.
With wide-angle, HD video and groundbreaking AI features, our cameras enable remote team collaboration wherever it happens, from office to home office.

### About the project:
Artificial intelligence is a prominent feature in Huddlys cameras, and a rapidly evolving field. AI development and research is an important part of Huddly, and we are always looking for new, innovative methods to improve our cameras and the user experiences they provide during video meetings.
Huddly hopes that this project will allow us to gain insight in new interactive functions that relies on video image over manual functions, that could provide more flexibility and convenience for communication through remote video.

### Technical requirements:
The students should train and test a working machine learning/deep learning model that can run on a live video. The functions related to the gestures they choose should be implemented in a working demo, only required to work locally. Students will be provided with a Huddly IQ wide-angle camera, and are free to choose what platforms and OS they use.
The recommended software tools are Python 3.6+ and well-documented libraries connected to Python 3.6+. This is to express that the task has been solved in a methodological and academic manor, and proving the students general insight of methods to solve such tasks.

Recommended libraries:
- Keras
- Tensorflow
- Numpy
- opencv
Other libraries can also be used.
